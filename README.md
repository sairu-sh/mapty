Aims to build a workout logger where users can keep records of the workouts; running or cycling with the markers on a map. They click on the map where they want to log their workout for the day and select whether they are running or cycling today and how much distance they want to cover. 

This is a learning project from the JavaScript course, "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022 From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann. The HTML and CSS code are written by Jonas.
The JS component however, is written from scratch. The JS component contains basic DOM manipulation, nested if-else conditional and function calls.

Used JavaScript's Leaflet library for interactive map rendering and Local Storage to store the logs.
